I was supposed to learn how to read, write and call from files. 
We used the functions we learned in class to make this program. Yes our 
results matched what we were supposed to get, everything works properly.
We first designed our program, then wrote the program, then tested the program
to make sure it works. The biggest challenge was figuring out the join, but once 
we figured it out it went smoothly. I think i did learn what I was supposed to during
this lab. it was nice working with Max.
